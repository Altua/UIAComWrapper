UIAComWrapper
=============

The UI Automation COM-to-.NET Adapter makes it possible to use the new Windows Automation API 3.0 COM interfaces, with their improved reliability and performance, while still using the same System.Windows.Automation classes as in earlier versions of UI Automation

Changes
-------
### v1.1.0.14 
- added source indexing with [GitLink](https://github.com/GitTools/GitLink). Makes issue debugging much easier as stepping into UIAComWrapper code in VS automatically downloads proper source code from GitHub.
